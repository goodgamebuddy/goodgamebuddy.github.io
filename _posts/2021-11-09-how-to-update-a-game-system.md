To update the rules for a game system, open up the app, click “Manage files” and click the game system. You'll be taken to a page where you can click on the "Check for updates" button to see if there are any updates available. If there are any updates, they will be listed after you click the "Check for Updates" button and an "Update" button will be displayed. Click on this and the rules for the game system will be updated. [This demo](/how-to-update-a-game-system/#demo) shows you how it's done.
