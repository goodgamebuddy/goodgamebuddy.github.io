Good Game Buddy is still being developed and should be regarded as "in testing". It is available for Android devices via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ggb.GoodGameBuddy). The app is not yet available for iOS or Windows but hopefully will be soon - you can help speed this up by [supporting us](/faq/funding/2021/11/13/support-us).

### Android {#android}
In addition to being available via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ggb.GoodGameBuddy), you can also install it onto an Android device by [downloading the apk file](https://github.com/goodgamebuddy/ggb/blob/main/android/ggb.GoodGameBuddy.apk?raw=true). You might [need to change your settings](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/what-is-an-apk-and-how-do-i-install-one) to do it this way, though.

### iOS {#ios}
As far as I know, in order to publish the app to iTunes I'll need access to a Mac. From [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/):

> Building native iOS applications requires access to Apple's build tools, which only run on a Mac

This is a bit of a problem, as I don't own a Mac. I think I should be able to get around this by using a Mac server in the cloud (from somewhere like [MacinCloud](https://www.macincloud.com/)), but this requires some time to set up. It also requires some money, albeit less than is required to buy a Mac!

### Windows {#windows}
It should be possible to make the app available on Windows, but for some reason my previous attempt at doing this failed. I couldn't get to the bottom of it at the time - it should just be a case of sitting down and working out what's going on. The app has been developed using Microsoft technology (Xamarin), so it really shouldn't be that hard to make it work on Microsoft's operating system...
