Good Game Buddy is still being developed and should be regarded as "in testing". It is available for Android devices via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ggb.GoodGameBuddy). The app is not yet available for iOS or Windows but hopefully will be soon - you can help speed this up by [supporting us](/faq/funding/2021/11/13/support-us).

An alternative method for installing onto an Android device is to [download the apk](https://github.com/goodgamebuddy/ggb/blob/main/android/ggb.GoodGameBuddy.apk?raw=true).
