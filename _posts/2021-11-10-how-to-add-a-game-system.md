Assuming you've installed [the app](/download-it), the next step is to [download a game system file](/how-to-add-a-game-system/#download-game-system-file) to your device. Once you've done that, open up the app and [add the file to it](/how-to-add-a-game-system/#add-game-system-file) by clicking "Manage files" then "Add game system file", and choosing the file that you just downloaded.
