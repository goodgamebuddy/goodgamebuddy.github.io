Assuming you've installed [the app](/faq/download/2021/11/14/download-it), the next step is to download a game system file to your device. Once you've done that, open up the app, click "Manage files" then "Add game system file", and choose the file that you just downloaded. The app will then download all the data files, and when it's done you'll be able to view the rules and profiles for that game system.

- open up the app
- click "Manage files"
- click "Add game system file"
- choose the file that you just downloaded
- wait while it downloads all the data files...
