Many thanks to

 - the people who have created and maintained the game system files that the app uses - your efforts are greatly appreciated!
 - my wife, for letting me work on the app when she'd much rather I painted the bedroom. The joke's on me, though - there are apparently four rooms that now need decorating.
 - my son, for letting me use his keyboard and mouse, and for occasionally giving me a few more minutes of programming time when he wanted the laptop to play Minecraft.
