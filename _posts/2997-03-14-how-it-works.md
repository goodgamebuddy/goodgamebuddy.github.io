The app makes use of data files created by the community. Once you've [got the app](/faq/download/2021/11/14/download-it) and [downloaded the files for a game system](/faq/how/2021/11/10/how-to-add-a-game-system) you'll be able to browse the game's rules and profiles without a connection to the internet. There's no fee to use the app and no ads, there's no need to log in and we don't collect any of your data. However, if you want the app to be developed further [we'll need your support](/faq/funding/2021/11/13/support-us).
