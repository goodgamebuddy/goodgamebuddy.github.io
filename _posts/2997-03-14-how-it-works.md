The app makes use of data files created by the community. Once you've downloaded the files for a game system you'll be able to browse the game's rules and profiles without a connection to the internet. There's no fee to use the app and no ads, there's no need to log in and we don't collect any of your data. However, if you want to the app to be developed further we'll need your support.
