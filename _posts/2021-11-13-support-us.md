I started development on the app in September 2021 and up until this point all the work that has been carried out has been for free. Sadly, I need money to afford the mortgage, to pay the bills, and to buy [Pickled Onion Monster Munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Munch). You can help with this by supporting us on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/goodgamebuddy). In return you'll be able to [have a say](/faq/how/2021/11/08/how-to-vote-in-polls) on what development work gets carried out next. The more supporters there are, the more time I'll be able to spend working on the app.
