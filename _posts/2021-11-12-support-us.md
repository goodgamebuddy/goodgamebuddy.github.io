I started development on the app in September 2021 and up until this point all the work that has been carried out has been for free. Sadly, I need money to afford the mortgage, to pay the bills, and to buy [Pickled Onion Monster Munch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Munch). You can help with this by supporting me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/goodgamebuddy). In return you'll be able to [have a say](/how-to-vote-in-polls) on what development work gets carried out next. The more supporters there are, the more time I'll be able to spend working on the app.

### Why Patreon? {#why-patreon}
I didn't want people to have to pay to use the app, but I thought some people might be willing to pay to help make it better. [Patreon](/patreon) seemed like a good idea as it would provide a monthly amount of money. Plus, it's something a lot of people in the hobby will be familiar with as it's used by lots of designers who create miniatures for 3D printing.

### Wouldn't KickStarter have been a better idea? {#kickstarter}
Maybe. I'm open to the idea of using KickStarter for specific pieces of development work (e.g. making the app available on iOS).

### Why not just make people pay for the app? {#why-free}
I'd rather it was free to use - I think it's better for the hobby that way.

### Couldn't you get money from ads instead? {#why-no-ads}
Yes, but they're annoying. I haven't looked into it, but I imagine you don't make much money out of them anyway. I guess I might be forced to go down this route if Patreon doesn't work for me.
