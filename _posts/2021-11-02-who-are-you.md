I live in South West England and have been a developer since the year 2000. During that time I've worked for a [Clinical Trials Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trials_unit), the [NHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nhs) and a university, mostly involving web applications (primarily .NET and SQL Server) but with something different every now and then.

The idea for the app came a couple of years ago. Back then, if I wanted to check the rules for a unit I'd open up BattleScribe on my phone and create a roster that contained that unit. This worked, but it was a bit of a faff and the output wasn't optimised for viewing on a phone (which is fair enough, as BattleScribe is focused on creating armies, not displaying rules). It occurred to me that you could create an app that used the same files but just showed the rules. However, a look at the XML files scared me off - they aren't the easiest things to understand! It would require a bit of spare time to get my head around it...

In 2020 I took the opportunity to leave my job. I left with some money in my pocket and it gave me the chance to have a career break and focus on my family. In September 2021 I started working on the app. I knew that sometime soon I was going to have to start earning money again, and I thought that with a big heap of luck I might be able to avoid having to get a "proper" job through being supported on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/goodgamebuddy).

I like eating crisps. Pickled Onion Monster Munch aren't necessarily my favourite, but they definitely have the best name.
