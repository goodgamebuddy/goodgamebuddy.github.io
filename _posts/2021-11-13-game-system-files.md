The data files that Good Game Buddy uses are the same as those used by BattleScribe. These files have been created by a group of selfless and public-spirited individuals, who keep the files up-to-date and (I assume) generally wander about being awesome. The app piggybacks on their fantastic work, using the files they've created for a game system to display its rules and profiles. It should work with any [of these files](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=battlescribe+data+files), but you should only use those that don't infringe on copyright or licensing (otherwise you'll be breaking the law).
