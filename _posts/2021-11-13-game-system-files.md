The data files that Good Game Buddy uses are the same as those used by BattleScribe. These files have been created by a group of selfless and public-spirited individuals, who keep the files up-to-date and (I assume) generally wander about being awesome. The app piggybacks on their fantastic work, using the files they've created for a game system to display its rules and profiles. You can find the files [using a search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=battlescribe+data+files), but you should only use those that don't infringe on copyright or licensing (otherwise you could be breaking the law). If you're interested in the game system file for [The 9th Age](http://www.the-ninth-age.com/) you can find it [here](https://github.com/goodgamebuddy/The-9th-Age/blob/master/GGB_Files/the9thage.ggb?raw=true). I'm planning to contact the creators of other games where the rules are available for free, so watch this space.
